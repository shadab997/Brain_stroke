# Brain_stroke_Prediction
## Indroduction
Damage to the brain from interruption of its blood supply.A stroke is a medical emergency.Symptoms of stroke include trouble walking, speaking and understanding, as well as paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.Early treatment with medication like tPA (clot buster) can minimise brain damage. Other treatments focus on limiting complications and preventing additional strokes.
## Aim of the Project
To predict the brain stroke of the persons based on attributes which are listed below
## Attribute Information
1) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
2) age: age of the patient
3) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

8) avgglucoselevel: average glucose level in blood
9) bmi: body mass index
10) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
11) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient
